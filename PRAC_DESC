       2.To communicate with Telegram API we are going to use python library called telepot.
       3.For code refer PRAC_1
       4.After executing PRAC_1 code, we will receive something like this:
            {'id': 1178748794, 'is_bot': True, 'first_name': 'AS', 'username': 'Al25bot', 'can_join_groups': True, 'can_read_all_group_messages': False, '
            supports_inline_queries': False}
       5. here we made our API , call getMe to Telegram which returns information about bot such as its username, bot id etc.
       6.Now we will add newly created bot to our telegram contact list and start conversation by sending /start.
